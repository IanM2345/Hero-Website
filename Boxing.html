He also quietly donates to a number of organizations, and is known to participate in charity events to raise funds for various causes.</p>

                            After an injury forced Alex Wassabi out of a meeting with KSI, the YouTuber decided to up the ante and take on two opponents in one night. He kicked off the first installment of the DAZN X Series 001 PPV by dominating rapper Swarmz before finishing him in the second round.The night’s first match marked KSI’s official return to influencer boxing. Shortly after the first bell rang, KSI jumped onto the offensive. Taking command of the ring and repeatedly forcing Swarmz into the corner. Despite being the heavy underdog, Swarmz managed to survive the first round despite being knocked down early into the match. KSI managed to land another knockdown strike onto Swarmz seconds into the second round, though he failed to get back up this time. With his impressive two-round TKO, KSI won his first match back into the boxing scene with plenty of time to prepare for his second bout of the night.

                            Joe Fournier, a 9-0 professional boxer, faced YouTube sensation KSI in the Misfits 007 main event. KSI, who had a stunning victory from his brother Deji on the undercard, was initially thought to have secured a knockout win. However, a stray accidental elbow caused the challenger to fall, and the fight is under review. KSI has issued a statement expressing disappointment and rival Jake Paul has called him a "fake." KSI also showed off his cat, Buu, on Twitter. Conor McGregor was impressed by KSI's performance.

                            Tommy Fury's decision win over YouTuber KSI has been altered after an incorrect scorecard was added up. Fury, half-brother of world heavyweight boxing champion Tyson, was a majority-decision winner against KSI in Manchester, with two scorecards reading 57-56 in Fury's favor. However, the 57-57 scorecard from judge Rafael Ramos was the result of incorrect maths, and Fury was a unanimous-decision victor. Fury remained unbeaten as a professional boxer with the win, despite being docked a point for illegal shots to KSI's head. KSI, who is known as Olajide Olatunji, mocked Fury after the fight, stating that Fury had to win to be considered a boxer.
